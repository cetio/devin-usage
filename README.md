# Devin Better ACP

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)](LICENSE.txt)

Devin Better ACP is a Devin Desktop status-bar extension that shows Codex
subscription allowance and Antigravity CLI allowance. It reads both through the
CLIs you are already signed in to.

```
Codex    Gemini (AG)    Other (AG)
```

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Devin Desktop | 1.90 or newer on Linux, or a VS Code-compatible host |
| `codex` | Signed in with a ChatGPT plan (`codex login`) |
| `agy` | Signed in (`agy`), version 1.2.16 or newer |

Both CLIs are resolved from `PATH`, `~/.local/bin`, or an explicit absolute path
in settings. The extension never reads, copies, or refreshes stored credentials.
Each CLI uses its own login and its own network calls.

## Installation

Build the VSIX and install it:

```sh
npm ci
npm run package
devin-desktop --install-extension bin/devin-better-acp-0.3.3.vsix
```

Reload the window after installing.

## Usage

| Surface | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Status bar | One labelled item per pool with no percentage. The native warning or error background tracks the most-used limit. |
| Hover | One line such as `5h: 6% quota used · Weekly: 17% quota used`, plus a muted line when the values are stale. |
| Click | Opens the native Quick Pick focused on the clicked pool. Each limit row shows its used percentage and reset time. |
| Navigation | Back steps from the settings page to the pool, then to the overview. |
| Refresh | The toolbar refresh updates the selected provider. The overview refreshes both. |

Antigravity meters the Gemini models and the Claude and GPT models as separate
pools, so Other (AG) does not describe the standalone Codex subscription. Codex
shows its plan and credit metadata under Details. Missing usage values stay
missing and stale results are labelled rather than shown as zero.

The items use stable identifiers (`devinBetterACP.codex`, `devinBetterACP.gemini`,
`devinBetterACP.other`), so the host's own hide and show menu and the visibility
settings both work.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `devinBetterACP.codex.enabled` | `true` | Enable the Codex provider |
| `devinBetterACP.codex.path` | empty | Absolute path to `codex` |
| `devinBetterACP.antigravity.enabled` | `true` | Enable the Antigravity provider |
| `devinBetterACP.antigravity.path` | empty | Absolute path to `agy` |
| `devinBetterACP.refreshIntervalSeconds` | `300` | Background refresh interval. `0` refreshes at startup and on request only. |
| `devinBetterACP.statusBar.alignment` | `right` | Status-bar side |
| `devinBetterACP.statusBar.showCodex` | `true` | Show the Codex item |
| `devinBetterACP.statusBar.showGemini` | `true` | Show the Gemini (AG) item |
| `devinBetterACP.statusBar.showOther` | `true` | Show the Other (AG) item |

Refreshes pause while the window is unfocused and back off after transient
failures. Polling stops after a sign-in, missing-CLI, or unsupported result
until you retry. Monitoring is paused in untrusted workspaces.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Devin Better ACP: Show Usage` | Open the details and actions menu |
| `Devin Better ACP: Refresh All` | Refresh both providers now |
| `Devin Better ACP: Retry Connection` | Retry a provider, including the CLI version check |
| `Devin Better ACP: Configure CLI Path` | Pick the CLI executable and store its absolute path |
| `Devin Better ACP: Open Settings` | Open the extension settings |
| `Devin Better ACP: Show Diagnostics` | Show classified provider state and recent refresh events |
| `Devin Better ACP: Open ChatGPT Usage Page` | Open the account usage page for Codex |

## How It Works

| Provider | Read-only integration | Verified on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | Ephemeral `codex app-server --stdio` with `initialize`, `account/read`, and `account/rateLimits/read` | codex-cli 0.160.0 |
| Antigravity | `agy --print /usage --output-format json --print-timeout 20s --mode plan` | agy 1.2.16 |

The Codex connection only performs those read requests and never starts a
thread or a turn. The Antigravity invocation is a standalone slash command that
reports zero model tokens, and polling stops if a future CLI version reports
otherwise.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run check          # type check
npm test               # type check + unit tests with fake CLIs
npm run package        # build and produce the VSIX
npm run package:files  # list the files that would ship
```

Unit tests run generated fake `codex` and `agy` executables from a temporary
directory. They never touch your real accounts.

`npm run test:integration` needs a host that forwards `--extensionTestsPath` to
the renderer. Devin Desktop 1.126 does not, so use the Extension Development
Host or an installed VSIX for manual verification:

```sh
devin-desktop --user-data-dir=/tmp/devin-better-acp-dev --extensions-dir=/tmp/devin-better-acp-ext \
  --extensionDevelopmentPath="$PWD"
```

Load the extension and confirm the items match `agy`'s `/usage` panel and the
Codex usage page for the same account.

## Antigravity ACP Patch

`bin/patch-agy-acp.py` patches the Antigravity ACP server so it assumes the
client is Zed, which allows using other models. It rewrites the packaged
`client_info` source and bytecode in place, preserves the PAR layout and file
size, and leaves a timestamped `.bak` backup beside the file.

Run the script directly to use it (at your own risk). Use the CPython version
matching the ACP's packaged bytecode, and pass the PAR path if it is not at the
default `~/.local/opt/agy-acp/current/agy_acp_server.par`.
