# Agents

## Verification

```sh
npm ci
npm run check                 # tsc --noEmit
npm test                      # build + unit tests (fake CLIs, no account access)
npm run package               # build the VSIX
npm run package:files         # list the packaged files
```

`npm run test:integration` needs a host that forwards `--extensionTestsPath` to
the renderer. Devin Desktop 1.126 does not (its window configuration only
carries an `isExtensionTestHost` boolean), so the extension-host test module
never runs there. Do not work around this by patching the application or by
weakening Electron flags; use the Extension Development Host or an installed
VSIX for host verification instead.

Manual host check:

```sh
devin-desktop --user-data-dir=/tmp/devin-better-acp-dev --extensions-dir=/tmp/devin-better-acp-ext \
  --extensionDevelopmentPath="$PWD"
```

## Integration boundaries

- Codex is read through an ephemeral `codex app-server --stdio` that may only
  send `initialize`, `initialized`, `account/read`, and
  `account/rateLimits/read`. Never start a thread or turn, never log in or out,
  and never consume reset credits or send nudge emails.
- Antigravity is read with the standalone
  `agy --print /usage --output-format json --print-timeout 20s --mode plan`
  invocation. Never pass `--disable-slash-commands`, never reword `/usage` as a
  prompt, and stop polling if the envelope reports nonzero token usage.
- The extension never discovers, reads, copies, or refreshes provider
  credentials, and never writes to provider configuration.
- CLI output is untrusted: validate shapes, bound output size, keep provider
  text escaped in hover markdown, and never surface raw stderr or API bodies.
- Status items use the host's native status-bar, hover, and Quick Pick APIs with
  stable identifiers so the application's own visibility controls keep working.
- Diagnostics stay redacted: provider name, CLI version, classified state,
  timings, and successful-refresh age only.

## ACP shim

`bin/antigravity-acp.py` is a standalone Python 3.10+ ACP bridge, separate from
read-only usage monitoring. It forwards sessions, MCP definitions, tools,
permissions, and client capabilities without rebuilding the conversation.
`--spoof-zed` changes only the downstream `initialize.clientInfo.name`;
`--registry-entry` prints a Desktop agent entry. Server arguments follow `--`.

The shim marks its presence in-band: the `initialize` response `agentInfo`
gains `title: "Antigravity (Devin shim)"` and a `+devin-shim` version suffix,
a `/devin-shim` command is merged into `available_commands_update` (with
`_meta.cognition.ai/category: "System"`) and answered locally (no model call)
with bridge status, and `--debug`/`--debug-log` writes a JSONL traffic log to
`~/.local/state/devin-better-acp/antigravity-acp.jsonl`.
`--devin-config` merges MCP servers from `<workspace>/.devin/mcp_config*.json`,
`<workspace>/.devin/config.json`, and `~/.config/devin/` (JSONC tolerated) into
`session/new` and `session/load`, so Antigravity sees the same tools as Devin
Local; client-supplied `mcpServers` always win on name conflicts, `disabled`
entries are skipped, and the initialize result advertises
`_meta.mcpConfigPath` pointing at `~/.config/devin/mcp_config.json`.

For rendering parity with Devin Local the shim synthesizes a
`session_info_update` (prompt-text title, once per session) since Antigravity
never emits one, and maps Antigravity `rawOutput` onto the Devin terminal
fields: `execute` `tool_call`s gain `_meta.terminal_info`, and
`tool_call_update`s gain `_meta.terminal_output` (`{terminal_id, data}` from
`combinedOutput`/`formatted_output`, or the raw string on failure) and
`_meta.terminal_exit` (`{terminal_id, exit_code}`) — the accumulated
`terminal_output.data` renders inline in `ExecuteToolCall`. Tool frames also
gain `_meta.cognition.ai/inferenceToolName` (`execute`→`exec`, `search`→`grep`,
other kinds pass through; `think`/`other`/`switch_mode` are skipped) matching
the field Devin Local puts on every tool frame. Do not add `{type: "terminal"}`
content blocks: they route rendering to the v2 terminal stream
(`terminal_update`/`terminal_output_chunk` events keyed by
`cognition.ai/eventId`), which the shim does not emit.

Measured against `devin acp` (SWE-2): Devin Local puts no stdout in frames
either — its exec calls stream the command into a `text/x-shellscript` preview
content block and report `"Exited with code N"`, while real output lives in the
client-owned terminal (`terminal/create`/`terminal/output` RPCs that
Antigravity never issues; it executes internally). Antigravity `read`/`edit`
updates carry no result body, so no "N lines" summary is possible without
interposing `fs/*` results — out of scope.

The registry `icon` must be an `http(s)` URL — Devin Desktop ignores `data:`
URIs and requires `Content-Type: image/svg+xml`. `images/antigravity-acp.svg`
is the white-fill mark served via jsDelivr from `main`; update `--icon-url` if
the repository URL changes.

`npm run test:acp` runs offline Python protocol tests and is included in
`npm test`. Live Gemini checks must be explicitly authorized and use an
isolated workspace; they are not part of automated verification. The shim
never reads credentials or provider configuration and never patches the
provider executable. Provider stderr is drained but not exposed.

An authorized live check uses `python3 tests/integration/acp.py --run-live`
(or adds `--registry <Desktop registry path>` to test the installed launch
entry). It selects an advertised Gemini model and verifies file edits,
command execution, MCP invocation, and permission round-trips in a temporary
workspace. `--run-live` is mandatory; the test never authenticates or changes
provider settings. Antigravity ACP 1.3.0 was verified with
`gemini-3.6-flash-low` and standard ACP v1 tool events.

## Style

TypeScript follows the conventions used in `~/Repos/autonom`: four-space
indentation, Allman braces, double quotes, camelCase functions, PascalCase
types, `ret` for explicit return values, `source/` for code, `tests/` for tests,
and `dist/` for build output. Group source modules by domain, mirror those
folders under `tests/unit/`, keep shared fixtures in `tests/support.ts`, and
put host checks in `tests/integration/`. Do not add comments unless they carry
protocol information that names cannot.
